          I started my career repairing electronic equipment at the Methodist University of SÃ£o Paulo, 
          then I was promoted to the information technology department, working with technical support, 
          completing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering in 2013, 
          I said goodbye to this university for which I am very grateful and 
          I went on an adventure through Brazil working with industrial automation, 
          programming smart scales for weighing soybeans across the country.

          Taken by the adventurous spirit, I moved to England and in the process of learning English I took a chance on the most diverse jobs,
          kitchen porter, courier, fitter furniture and finally, returning to my technological career,
          working remotely as a Front End Developer.

          Improving my focus is my daily struggle. Software that uses neuroscience and complex resources have been increased, 
          they easily get our attention. It's been hard work to be focused amidst the war of who gets my attention, 
          but through personal development and meditation, I've become a person a lot more focused on my job.
